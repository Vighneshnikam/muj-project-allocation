The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

There are two types of AI: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a narrow task (like facial recognition or internet searches), and General AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do. AI can be categorized as either weak or strong. Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is an AI system that is designed and trained for a particular task. Virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, are a form of weak AI. Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, is an AI system with generalized human cognitive abilities. When presented with an unfamiliar task, a strong AI system is able to find a solution without human intervention.</p>";}s:13:"finish_reason";s:4:"stop";}}s:5:"usage";a:3:{s:13:"prompt_tokens";i:41;s:12:"total_tokens";i:249;s:17:"completion_tokens";i:208;}}}
